Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a card game as part of an advanced programming course assignment. The project demonstrates the use of C++ with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and dynamic memory management.

Project Description
The game is a single-player card game where the player battles against computer-controlled monsters. The player selects a character and an enemy, each with specific attributes and abilities. The game involves selecting and playing card sets to deal damage to the enemy or heal the player.

Characters and Enemies
Characters:

Fighter: 60 health points, 6 cards maximum.
Sorcerer: 40 health points, 8 cards maximum.
Ranger: 50 health points, 7 cards maximum.
Enemies:

Troll: 100 health points, deals 5 damage.
Ghost: 50 health points, deals 15 damage.
Dragon: 75 health points, deals 10 damage.
Game Mechanics
Card Sets:

Valid sets are either a single card or multiple cards of the same rank whose total value is less than or equal to 10.
Special card suits (diamonds, hearts, clubs, spades) have unique effects during play.
Gameplay:

The player selects and plays cards from their hand each turn.
The game calculates damage dealt to the enemy and healing for the player based on the card set played.
Each enemy has specific interactions with the player’s abilities based on the card suits.
Features
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes classes and inheritance to define the game’s characters, enemies, and card mechanics.
Dynamic Memory Management: Proper handling of dynamic memory allocation and deallocation to prevent memory leaks and errors.
C++ Standard Library: Utilizes features from the C++ Standard Library for efficient and effective programming.
Getting Started
To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

:

Smart Pointers: To automatically manage memory and ensure no memory leaks.
Exception Handling: To gracefully handle errors and exceptions during memory allocation and other operations.
